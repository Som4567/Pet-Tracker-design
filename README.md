Pet-Tracker is an untapped potential of Indian market which is expected to show a huge growth in
the upcoming years.
This document provides a block diagram of the hardware design of the pet-tracker based on the
latest low-power technologies like LoRa, BLE etc.
Options of incorporating heart rate monitor IC, Temperature IC etc. not provide parameters for pet
health but also provide security features
Various considerations have been listed which can help to build a low-power design, extend the
battery life of the hardware and reduce the manufacturing cost of the hardware.
A detailed flow of the hardware design starting from the manufacturing of the PCB to the Packaging
and distribution gives an insight of the various stages/steps involved in the commercial production
and distribution of the pet-tracker.
A overview of the estimation of the cost involved in the various stages of manufacturing and
distribution of the hardware in India is a good reference to proceed in this direction.
